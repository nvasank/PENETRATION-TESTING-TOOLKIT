# PENETRATION-TESTING-TOOLKIT
Penetration Testing Toolkit – Description

The **Penetration Testing Toolkit** is a Python-based, modular security application engineered for ethical hackers, cybersecurity professionals, and network administrators. Designed with versatility and usability in mind, this toolkit consolidates a wide range of penetration testing capabilities—such as port scanning, SSH brute-forcing, subdomain enumeration, and vulnerability scanning—into a single, command-line interface. Whether you're simulating an attack scenario or conducting routine security assessments, this toolkit empowers users to probe system defenses effectively and responsibly.

### Modular Design for Targeted Testing
Each feature of the toolkit is built as an independent module, making the codebase clean, extensible, and easy to maintain. Users can selectively run modules based on their testing requirements without dealing with bloated, monolithic scripts. This approach supports agility in real-world penetration tests, where flexibility and quick adaptation are crucial.

### What's Inside?
Here’s a breakdown of the modules included in the toolkit:

- **Port Scanner**: Quickly scans TCP ports on a target host to identify open ports and potential services exposed to the internet.

- **SSH Brute Forcer**: Performs brute-force attacks on SSH services using custom wordlists to test for weak credentials (educational use only).

- **Directory Fuzzer**: Attempts to discover hidden or unlinked directories and endpoints on a web server using wordlists.

- **Subdomain Enumerator**: Identifies subdomains associated with a target domain using a list of known prefixes.

- **WHOIS Lookup**: Retrieves domain registration and ownership details to assist with reconnaissance.

- **IP Geolocator**: Maps an IP address to a physical location using public geolocation APIs.

- **Hash Cracker**: Attempts to crack SHA-256 hashes by comparing them to a user-supplied wordlist.

- **Vulnerability Scanner**: Compares extracted service banners to a mock database of known vulnerabilities.

- **Report Generator**: Aggregates scan results into a basic, human-readable report to aid in documentation and presentation.

Each module relies on well-supported libraries like requests, paramiko, and python-whois, ensuring reliable operation and cross-platform compatibility.

### Why This Toolkit Matters
In today’s cybersecurity landscape, threats are constantly evolving, and so must our tools for defense. While enterprise-level solutions exist, they are often costly and complex. This toolkit serves as a lightweight, educational, and highly functional alternative for:

- Cybersecurity interns and students

- Bug bounty participants

- Red team members and security consultants

- Developers building secure applications

By using this toolkit, professionals can validate network configurations, identify weak points, simulate common attack vectors, and ultimately strengthen security postures.
